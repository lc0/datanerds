<p>So community, like one smart guy said recently: &ldquo;If you want to use some nice technology, use it now&rdquo;.
If you like something, you need actually to start pushing it forward. I do like data science, machine learning and
other amazing  things, that help you to understand data, so I&rsquo;d like to commit into that field.</p>

<h2 id="mooc-knowledge-sharing-and-other-nice-things">MOOC, knowledge sharing and other nice things</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with a problems, or why do I start something here. Since I moved to Munich I was
really inspired by local community. We always talking about current global view of information,
And it&rsquo;s completely true, honestly nowadays we have the best ever time to learn something new, just open
a browser and start learning your dream topic from professionals. With maturing of MOOC(Massive Open Online Courses)
it was never so easy to start learning something completely new.</p>

<p>Yes, of course, it&rsquo;s a good point to start, but you need more. Even when you have some ideas to discuss with
other like-minded people, so it&rsquo;s another stage, to have other people to discuss with, yes, you could do it online,
but if you could meet people in face it&rsquo;s even more exiting.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>So the main idea behind this website is to build online representation of User Groups.
Nothing about actually building community, but more about a collaborative space where people
could easily share everything exciting about data science, machine learning and other data-related thoughts.</p>

<p>Hence, I&rsquo;m going to share here announcements on data-related events, share nice videos and other interesting things
on topics described above. Everyone is invited to send a pull-request to share the knowledge with community.</p>
