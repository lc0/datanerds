Recently found a good presentation about actionable customer development for startups. Yes, it sounds like some buzzwords, 
but in presentations you could find the first stage of every idea - validation. The most interesting part of the workshop
is recommendations about performing correct user interviews to validate the idea.

Usually it's a very first big mistake of funders, because we so much believe in our idea. We love it so much, that are ready to ask 
the wrong questions just to find some confirmation of our ideas. But much better to ask correct questions and to find the real user
problems or even pains, than just to work on the problem nobody has. 

Fail fast! Fail cheap!
