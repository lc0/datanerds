We are ready to have our first meetup in 2014! This time the guys from the GiniPay app (Gini) will sponsor the event and provide the venue as well as food and refreshments.

We will have 2 talks, one about a compiler of Hive and Hadoop and one about the intersection of Music and Machine Learning. Besides, Gini will give a short presentation and demo of their application, which uses Machine Learning and NLP underneath.

Format:
- 2 presentations (each ca. 30 min incl. discussion)
- Of course time for networking + food + drinks before, in between and especially after the presentations
- Talks are held in English.
Talks

Details soon.

- Vladimir Viro (LMU):

"Creating an optimal court musician and other computational pursuits -
a common sense musical data base and what can be learned from it."

Description:
If music be the food of computers, how shall we prepare it? indeed, how shall we prepare them? This talk is a quick tour of a kitchen filled with musical ingredients, with some finger food served, and an invitation for more cooking together.

I demonstrate systems that collect large quantities of musical data, both symbolic (hundreds of millions of notes) and expressive (tens of thousands of hours of recordings). I present applications that provide insights into music history and practice, and show some fairly simple algorithms capturing higher-level musical categories surprisingly well. I then talk about an interactive application that involves humans and algorithms playing with each other and constantly learning from the experience.

Bio:
Vladimir Viro studied violin and piano in Saint-Petersburg for ten years since the age of six. However, instead of following a musical path he became interested in mathematics and pursued to study it. He has received a diploma in mathematics and informatics at the LMU München. During his studies Vladimir set out to develop an intelligent musical instrument, thereby combining his interests in music and algorithms. While working on his diploma thesis in 2011 he proposed his two year old side project (a search engine for scanned sheet music Peachnote.com) for the Google Research Award and won it. The award funded further research and development in musical signal processing and data mining. Growing the project, Vladimir, joined by a few friends, recently secured follow-up funding from the EXIST program of BMWi. He is (co-)supervising music-related bachelor and master theses in informatics at the LMU and TUM.



- Sven Bayer:

"SQL in Hadoop"

Description:
This talk describes the Query Compiler of Hive for MapReduce. The architecture of the Hive Query Compiler is explained. Additionally, the compilation of a SQL-query to a MapReduce-Job is shown.

Bio:
Sven Bayer is studying Master of Information Technology at the University of Applied Sciences in Rosenheim. He is currently working on his Master-thesis at QAware GmbH. In this thesis he will construct a Business Intelligence solution, based on Hadoop, to discover relationships between Software-metrics and project controlling. Furthermore, he will evaluate the performance of alternative frameworks to Hive that provide SQL in Hadoop.
