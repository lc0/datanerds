So community, like one smart guy said recently: "If you want to use some nice technology, use it now".
If you like something, you need actually to start pushing it forward. I do like data science, machine learning and
other amazing  things, that help you to understand data, so I'd like to commit into that field.

MOOC, knowledge sharing and other nice things
-------------------------------------
Let's start with a problems, or why do I start something here. Since I moved to Munich I was
really inspired by local community. We always talking about current global view of information,
And it's completely true, honestly nowadays we have the best ever time to learn something new, just open
a browser and start learning your dream topic from professionals. With maturing of MOOC(Massive Open Online Courses)
it was never so easy to start learning something completely new.

Yes, of course, it's a good point to start, but you need more. Even when you have some ideas to discuss with
other like-minded people, so it's another stage, to have other people to discuss with, yes, you could do it online,
but if you could meet people in face it's even more exiting.

TL;DR
------------
So the main idea behind this website is to build online representation of User Groups.
Nothing about actually building community, but more about a collaborative space where people
could easily share everything exciting about data science, machine learning and other data-related thoughts.

Hence, I'm going to share here announcements on data-related events, share nice videos and other interesting things
on topics described above. Everyone is invited to send a pull-request to share the knowledge with community.
